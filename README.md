#GetQuotes

This is a quote scraper inspired by Nicholas Dibari's Project.

Rather than asking for an argument to fetch quotes from BrainyQuote,
this program randomly selects from a buch of topics stored in an array containing the topics and then outputs the topic as well
as a randomly selected quote to the screen.

It also saves the quote, its topic, system time and like/dislike into a csv file
